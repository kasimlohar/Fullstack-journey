# JavaScript Projects

This directory contains various JavaScript projects that demonstrate fundamental and intermediate concepts. Each subfolder is organized by topic and includes an `index.html` file that loads its corresponding `app.js` file.

## Directory Structure

- **Part_2:**  
  Contains practice and assignment questions focusing on conditionals, loops, and basic input/output in JavaScript.  
  _Topics include:_
  - Traffic light system simulation.
  - Price determination based on size.
  - String evaluations and number safety checks.
  - Switch-case usage for days and quarters.

- **Part_3:**  
  Focuses on string manipulation methods.  
  _Topics include:_
  - Trimming whitespace.
  - Slicing substrings.
  - Finding substrings with `indexOf`.
  - Replacing text within strings.

- **Part_4:**  
  Demonstrates number and array manipulation techniques.  
  _Topics include:_
  - Counting digits in a number.
  - Summing digits.
  - Calculating factorials.
  - Finding the largest element in an array.

- **Part_5:**  
  Provides examples with objects and random number generation.  
  _Topics include:_
  - Generating random numbers (e.g., dice roll).
  - Defining and using objects for cars and persons.

- **Part_6:**  
  A placeholder for future JavaScript experiments and code.  
  _Topics include:_
  - Additional projects and exercises can be added here.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the desired subfolder (e.g., `Part_2`, `Part_3`, etc.).
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  
   The HTML file includes a `<script>` tag that loads the corresponding `app.js` file.
3. Check the browser console (F12 or right-click and inspect) to view any output from `console.log` statements.

## Customization

- Feel free to uncomment code blocks in `app.js` files to test different examples.
- Modify or extend the code to experiment with additional JavaScript features.
- These projects serve as a learning reference and playground for practicing JavaScript.

## Additional Topics

If you'd like to explore further topics, consider adding new sections such as:
- **DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with HTML elements using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** Adding and managing event listeners.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Using callbacks, promises, or async/await.
- **APIs and Fetch:** Making HTTP requests to external services.
