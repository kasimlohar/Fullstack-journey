## How to Run
1. Navigate to any subfolder (e.g., `CSS_part_3`, `Bootstrap`, or `CSS_part_2`) and open its `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Each subfolder is independent, so you can modify the HTML or CSS files to experiment with different styling techniques.

## Customization
- Feel free to edit the files to add more content, change styles, or try out new CSS properties.
- These projects serve as a reference and playground for learning and practicing CSS.
