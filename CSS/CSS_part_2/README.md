  - Demonstrates layout of posts and interactive buttons

- **inheritance_demo.html**  
  A simple page showcasing CSS inheritance with headings, forms, and text content.  
  _Key Features:_  
  - A demonstration of how CSS rules applied to parent elements inherit to children

- **inheritance_style.css**  
  A basic stylesheet for the inheritance demo that applies a background color to all `<div>` elements.

- **PracticeQs.html**  
  A practice page that mimics a simple Facebook-like interface with login, register buttons, and a search functionality.

- **PracticeQs.css**  
  A stylesheet for the Practice Questions page that applies a Courier New font and styles buttons and headings.

- **style.css**  
  The main stylesheet for the **index.html** page, demonstrating a variety of CSS selectors, combinators, and pseudo-classes/elements.

## How to Run

1. Open any of the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`, `inheritance_demo.html`, or `PracticeQs.html`) in your web browser.
2. The associated CSS files will style the pages accordingly. You can modify the CSS files to see how changes affect the page rendering.

## Customization
